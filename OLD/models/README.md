## Function: `build_cnn_encoder(image_size)`

### **Purpose**
This function constructs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based encoder to extract feature representations from images. It leverages a pre-trained InceptionV3 model to benefit from transfer learning, utilizing its feature extraction capabilities while excluding its classification layers. The encoder outputs a feature vector for each input image, which is subsequently used by the decoder for caption generation.

### **Arguments**
- **`image_size`** (`int`):  
  The size to which input images will be resized. This ensures that all images have a uniform size compatible with the input requirements of the InceptionV3 model.

### **Returns**
- **`tf.keras.Model`**:  
  A TensorFlow/Keras model that takes an image as input and outputs a feature vector. This model is specifically designed for feature extraction and does not perform classification.

### **Key Steps**
1. **Load Pre-trained InceptionV3 Model**:  
   The function loads the InceptionV3 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, excluding its top classification layer (`include_top=False`). This transforms it into a feature extractor.

2. **Freeze Pre-trained Weights**:  
   To retain the knowledge from pre-training, all layers of the base model are frozen, preventing them from being updated during training.

3. **Add Global Average Pooling**:  
   A global average pooling layer is added to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps output by the InceptionV3 model, converting them into a fixed-size feature vector.

4. **Model Definition**:  
   A new model is defined using the input layer from the InceptionV3 base model and the output from the global average pooling layer.

### **Use Case**
The `build_cnn_encoder` function is an integral part of an image captioning system. It transforms high-dimensional image data into a compact feature vector that represents the content of the image. These features are used as input to a caption-generation decoder (e.g., an LSTM-based RNN).

### **Example Usage**
```python
image_size = 224  # Images will be resized to 224x224
cnn_encoder = build_cnn_encoder(image_size)



## Function: `build_rnn_decoder(vocab_size, embedding_dim, max_caption_length)`

### **Purpose**
This function builds a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based decoder to generate captions for images. It uses an Embedding layer to convert word indices into dense vector representations and an LSTM network for sequential processing of input text. The decoder predicts the next word in the caption sequence based on the current word and the context provided by previous words.

### **Arguments**
- **`vocab_size`** (`int`):  
  The total number of unique words in the vocabulary. This determines the size of the output layer and the embedding input dimension.

- **`embedding_dim`** (`int`):  
  The dimensionality of the word embeddings. This defines the size of the dense vector representation for each word.

- **`max_caption_length`** (`int`):  
  The maximum number of words in a caption. This defines the sequence length processed by the RNN.

### **Returns**
- **`tf.keras.Model`**:  
  A TensorFlow/Keras model that takes a sequence of word indices as input and predicts the next word in the sequence. The output is a probability distribution over the vocabulary.

### **Key Steps**
1. **Input Layer**:  
   The function starts with an input layer that accepts a sequence of word indices of length `max_caption_length`.

2. **Embedding Layer**:  
   Converts each word index into a dense vector of size `embedding_dim`. This layer learns a distributed representation of words during training.

3. **LSTM Layers**:  
   - The first LSTM layer processes the sequential input, capturing contextual information.  
   - The second LSTM layer further refines the context and outputs a feature vector representing the sequence.

4. **Dense Output Layer**:  
   A fully connected layer with a `softmax` activation function is used to predict the probability distribution over the vocabulary for the next word.

5. **Model Definition**:  
   The input layer and the final output layer are connected through the intermediate layers to define the RNN decoder.

### **Use Case**
The `build_rnn_decoder` function is an essential component of the image captioning model. It decodes image features (from the encoder) and caption sequences into a meaningful caption by predicting words iteratively.

### **Example Usage**
```python
vocab_size = 5000         # Size of the vocabulary
embedding_dim = 256       # Dimension of word embeddings
max_caption_length = 20   # Maximum length of captions

rnn_decoder = build_rnn_decoder(vocab_size, embedding_dim, max_caption_length)
```



## Function: `build_image_captioning_model(cnn_encoder, rnn_decoder, image_size, max_caption_length)`

### **Purpose**
This function combines the CNN encoder and RNN decoder into a unified image captioning model. It takes an image and a sequence of words (caption) as input and predicts the next word in the caption sequence. The model leverages the CNN encoder for extracting image features and the RNN decoder for sequential language generation.

### **Arguments**
- **`cnn_encoder`** (`tf.keras.Model`):  
  The CNN-based encoder model for extracting feature vectors from images. This model is typically built using the `build_cnn_encoder` function.

- **`rnn_decoder`** (`tf.keras.Model`):  
  The RNN-based decoder model for generating captions. This model is typically built using the `build_rnn_decoder` function.

- **`image_size`** (`int`):  
  The size to which input images are resized before being passed to the CNN encoder.

- **`max_caption_length`** (`int`):  
  The maximum number of words in a caption. This determines the sequence length expected by the RNN decoder.

### **Returns**
- **`tf.keras.Model`**:  
  A complete image captioning model that takes two inputs: an image and a sequence of word indices (partial caption). The output is the predicted probability distribution for the next word in the caption.

### **Key Steps**
1. **Input Layers**:  
   - **Image Input**: A tensor of shape `(None, image_size, image_size, 3)` for input images.  
   - **Caption Input**: A tensor of shape `(None, max_caption_length)` for sequences of word indices.

2. **Image Feature Extraction**:  
   The image input is passed through the CNN encoder, which extracts a feature vector representing the image content.

3. **Feature Concatenation**:  
   The extracted image features are reshaped and concatenated with the word embedding sequence input to provide contextual information to the decoder.

4. **Caption Generation**:  
   The combined features are passed through the RNN decoder, which predicts the next word in the sequence.

5. **Model Definition**:  
   The function creates a `tf.keras.Model` connecting the image input and caption input to the decoder's output.

### **Use Case**
The `build_image_captioning_model` function creates the final end-to-end model for the image captioning task. It combines feature extraction and caption generation into a single trainable model.

### **Example Usage**
```python
### Define CNN Encoder
image_size = 224
cnn_encoder = build_cnn_encoder(image_size)

### Define RNN Decoder
vocab_size = 5000
embedding_dim = 256
max_caption_length = 20
rnn_decoder = build_rnn_decoder(vocab_size, embedding_dim, max_caption_length)

### Build Image Captioning Model
image_captioning_model = build_image_captioning_model(cnn_encoder, rnn_decoder, image_size, max_caption_length)
