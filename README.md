# Image Captioning using CNN

This repository contains an implementation of an image captioning model that combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate captions for images. The CNN (InceptionV3) is used for feature extraction, and the RNN processes the extracted features to generate text captions.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow (>= 2.x)
- NumPy

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
```

## Steps to Use the Model

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 2. Prepare Dataset

1. **Images**: Place the image files in a folder.
2. **Captions**: Create a text file or list in the script containing corresponding captions for each image.

Update the paths to the image files and their captions in the `train_model` function.

### 3. How the Model Works

#### a. Feature Extraction with CNN (InceptionV3)
- The pre-trained InceptionV3 model is used as a feature extractor. It processes the images to extract high-dimensional feature representations (2048-dimensional vectors).
- Images are preprocessed by resizing them to the required dimensions (299x299), converting them to arrays, and applying InceptionV3-specific preprocessing steps.
- The `build_image_model` function builds the CNN model that outputs these feature vectors, which are used as inputs for the RNN model.

#### b. Text Processing and Tokenization
- Captions are tokenized using Keras's `Tokenizer` to convert them into sequences of integers. Each word in the vocabulary is assigned a unique integer.
- Captions are padded to ensure uniform length using `pad_sequences`.
- Vocabulary size and maximum caption length are calculated to define the model architecture.

#### c. Caption Generation with RNN
- The RNN model takes image features and caption sequences as inputs.
- The image features are passed through a dense layer to reduce dimensionality.
- Captions are embedded using an Embedding layer, followed by processing with an LSTM layer to capture temporal dependencies.
- The image features and caption embeddings are combined using an `Add` layer, and the output is passed through dense layers to predict the next word in the caption sequence.

### 4. Run the Training Script

Execute the following command to train the model:
```bash
python image_captioning_cnn.py
```

The script will:
- Extract features from images using the InceptionV3 model.
- Tokenize captions and prepare the input data.
- Train the combined CNN-RNN model.
- Save the trained model to a file named `image_captioning_model.h5`.

### 5. Predict Captions for New Images

Modify the script to load the trained model and pass a new image for captioning. Example:
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load the trained model
model = load_model("image_captioning_model.h5")

# Process a new image
image_path = "path/to/new_image.jpg"
img = preprocess_image(image_path)
features = model_cnn.predict(img)

# Generate caption (example logic to be implemented)
caption = generate_caption(features)
print("Generated Caption:", caption)
```

### 6. Customization

- Adjust hyperparameters like `epochs`, `batch_size`, and model architecture in the script.
- Replace the sample dataset with a larger dataset for better accuracy.

### 7. Dependencies and Environment

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may also use virtual environments for isolation:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 8. Notes

- The script includes preprocessing for images and tokenization for text.
- Replace placeholder data with your actual dataset for meaningful results.
